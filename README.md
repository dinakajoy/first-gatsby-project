# Test Project
This is my first gatsby project. In this project, I implemented features like Dynamic page generation, Routing, GraphQL, Styling, Page Query, Component Query, etc

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Start developing.**

  Clone the project
  Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and run `npm install`

  ```shell
  npm run develop
  ```

2.  **Open the code and start customizing!**

  Your site is now running at http://localhost:8000!

  Edit `src/pages/index.js` to see your site update in real-time!
